# Default WSL Folder

* This folder is meant to be open daily and kept open throughout the day, it allows me to open new codespaces and work throughout the day knowing every instance of VS Code will be open in my WSL.
* Working on a more streamlined way to open VS Code everytime using WSL without using the terminal.
